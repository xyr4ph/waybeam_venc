# Maruko ↔ Star6E Feature Parity Plan

Living plan for bringing the Maruko backend up to feature parity with Star6E.
Re-evaluate after every phase. Update this file when re-ordering or
dropping phases.

## Code-verified current state (May 2026)

Audit was driven by reading source, not summaries. Differs from
`CURRENT_STATUS_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md` and `DUAL_BACKEND_SPLIT_PLAN.md` in
several places (see "Surprises vs docs" below).

### Already at parity

| Area | Evidence |
|---|---|
| HTTP API callbacks | `star6e_controls.c:1130-1149` vs `maruko_controls.c:1042-1061` — identical except `apply_mute=NULL` on Maruko |
| Codec / rate control | `star6e_pipeline.c:521-552`, `maruko_pipeline.c:638-776` — H.264/H.265 + CBR/VBR/AVBR both sides |
| Sensor unlock (IMX415/IMX335 cold-boot latch) | `maruko_pipeline.c:930-933` |
| Scene detector + IDR insert | `maruko_runtime.c:27-28`, sidecar telemetry wired (`maruko_pipeline.c:1295,1489`) |
| RTP sidecar / transport telemetry | `query_transport_status` bound on both |
| IQ system (AE/AWB tuning) | `maruko_iq.c` (736 lines) ≈ `star6e_iq.c` (800 lines) parity |
| Frame-lost overshoot protection | shared `pipeline_common_frame_lost_threshold()` |

### Verified gaps on Maruko

| Gap | Star6E location | Maruko status | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~Aspect-ratio precrop~~ | ~~`star6e_pipeline.c:338-386`~~ | **Closed in v0.9.9** — `configure_maruko_scl()` writes a centered rect via `pipeline_common_compute_precrop()` (Star6E parity); `venc_config.h:51-54` comment updated. | — |
| ~~Debug OSD overlay~~ | ~~`star6e_runtime.c:825-835`, `star6e_pipeline.c:1106-1108`~~ | **Closed in v0.9.10 (code) + v0.9.11 (runtime)** — full Star6E parity, runtime verified live on 192.168.2.12. | — |
| ~~IMU / BMI270~~ | ~~`star6e_pipeline.c:1084-1102` + `star6e_runtime.c:827,848,857`~~ | **Closed in v0.9.13 (PR #84)** — BMI270 detected at 0x68 / `i2c-1` after sensor swap, port verified live: 1963 samples drained over 9 s @ 118 fps, 0 errors. Maruko-specific ordering caveat: `imu_init` must precede `bind_maruko_pipeline` / `MI_VENC_StartRecvPic` (Star6E pattern stalls the encoder fd's `poll()`). | — |
| Live AR-change reinit | Star6E SIGHUP rebuilds VIF/VPE for AR change | `maruko_runtime.c:99-107` forces sensor mode lock to avoid ISP hang | Medium-arch |
| ~~`apply_mute`~~ | ~~`star6e_controls.c:1139`~~ | **Closed in v0.9.15** — `apply_mute = maruko_audio_apply_mute` (`maruko_controls.c`). | — |
| ~~Audio capture (MI_AI)~~ | ~~`star6e_audio.c` 738 lines~~ | **Closed in v0.9.15** — full Phase 5 port: vendor `libmi_ai.so` / `libmi_ao.so`, new `maruko_ai_impl` shim, new `src/maruko_audio.c` against the i6c `Open/AttachIf/EnableChnGroup/Read/ReleaseData` API.  Shared `audio_codec.{c,h}` helper hosts Opus / G.711 / stdout-filter for both backends.  Maruko TS files automatically gain audio PMT when capture is active. | — |
| ~~TS recording (mirror + dual)~~ | ~~`star6e_ts_recorder.c` 421 + `ts_mux.c` 430~~ | **Closed in v0.9.14** — promoted recorder sources to shared `RECORDER_SRC`, added `src/maruko_ts_recorder.c` adapter for `i6c_venc_strm`, wired `mode="mirror"` (chn 0) and `mode="dual"` (chn 1). Raw `.hevc` mode + HTTP record start/stop deferred to Phase 6.5. | — |
| Dual VENC (Gemini mode) | `star6e_pipeline.c:1335-1426`, `star6e_runtime.c:528-555` | None | High — needs SDK probe |
| 3A perf throttle | n/a (Star6E has cus3a; Maruko's NATIVE 3A_Proc_0 spends ~60% CPU at 120 fps) | **Closed in v0.9.12 (PR #83)** — opt-in `isp.aeMode="throttle"` swaps SDK NATIVE AE for a no-op AE adaptor + 15 Hz manual `SetAeParam`; saves ~24% sys CPU at 120 fps. Default `"native"` preserves existing behaviour. | — |

### N/A on Maruko (SDK-limited)

- **Custom 3A daemon** (`star6e_cus3a.c`, 562 lines): no `MI_ISP_CUS3A`
  surface in current Maruko SDK. Status: blocked by SDK, not by us.
  Revisit when Maruko SDK refresh lands.

### Surprises vs existing docs

1. **Rate-control overshoot floor** — memory said "120% threshold + 512kbps
   floor for Star6E only", but it is shared via
   `pipeline_common_frame_lost_threshold()` and runs on Maruko too.
2. **Sensor unlock cold-boot latch** is on Maruko
   (`maruko_pipeline.c:930-933`); `CURRENT_STATUS` implied Star6E-only.
3. **Maruko reinit locks the sensor mode** (`maruko_runtime.c:99-107`) —
   explicit constraint not called out in `DUAL_BACKEND_SPLIT_PLAN`.

---

## Phased plan (Quick wins → architectural)

Each phase ends with build-both + remote test on `192.168.2.12` (Maruko
bench, imx415) before moving on. Re-evaluate after every phase.

### Phase 0 — Bookkeeping (≈30 min)

Update stale docs so the plan starts from a true baseline.

- [ ] Rewrite `DUAL_BACKEND_SPLIT_PLAN.md` "Maruko Follow-Up Backlog" against
  verified gaps above.
- [ ] Mark cold-boot unlock + frame-lost protection as "ported" in
  `CURRENT_STATUS_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md`.
- [x] Replace the "until SCL crop port lands" comment in
  `venc_config.h:51-54` (done with Phase 1 in v0.9.9).

### Phase 1 — Aspect-ratio SCL precrop (DONE, v0.9.9)

**Why first:** documented gap, narrow blast radius, no SDK probing needed,
immediately fixes geometry on every non-16:9 encode.

- [x] Compute center-crop rect when encode AR ≠ sensor mode AR
  (re-using `pipeline_common_compute_precrop()`; computed against the
  post-binning effective input so it matches what actually reaches the
  SCL stage).
- [x] Wire into `configure_maruko_scl()`'s `scl_port.crop`.
- [x] Default `isp.keepAspect=true`; `false` falls back to zero-crop
  (full sensor → downstream stretch).
- [x] Hooked into `venc_api_set_active_precrop()` /
  `clear_active_precrop()` for `/api/v1/config` parity with Star6E.
- [x] **Verified on `192.168.2.12` (IMX415):**
  - 960x720 (4:3) on 1920x1080 sensor mode → `Precrop: 1920x1080 ->
    1440x1080 (offset 240,0)`, encoding 89 fps @ 25 Mbps cleanly,
    visually correct on screen.
  - 1280x720 (16:9) on 1920x1080 → no precrop, full source.
  - 4:3 with `keepAspect=false` → no precrop (legacy stretch path).

### Phase 2 — Debug OSD overlay code parity (DONE, v0.9.10)

Code parity with Star6E in place and the opt-in flag `debug.showOsd=true`
honored end-to-end on both backends:
`debug_osd_create()` after VENC start in
`maruko_pipeline_configure_graph()`, per-frame
`begin/sample_cpu/text/end_frame` in `maruko_pipeline_process_stream()`,
`debug_osd_destroy()` at the top of `maruko_pipeline_teardown_graph()`.
`debug_osd.c` + `debug_osd_draw.c` are in `HELPER_SRC`.  Default-off
leaves both backends untouched.  v0.9.10 shipped a temporary safety gate
(WARN-and-skip) on Maruko while Phase 2b investigated the runtime
crash; that gate was removed in Phase 2b.

### Phase 2b — Maruko OSD runtime fix (DONE, v0.9.11)

Root cause turned out NOT to be the lib/kernel vintage mismatch
originally suspected — it was a build-time conditional bug in
`src/debug_osd.c`.  The Maruko build defines BOTH `-DPLATFORM_STAR6E`
and `-DPLATFORM_MARUKO` (Star6E shim headers reused for type compat;
see `Makefile:39`).  `debug_osd.c` started with `#ifdef PLATFORM_STAR6E`,
so the Star6E ABI branch (1-arg `MI_RGN_Init`, mod_id 0 = VPE, 3-arg
`AttachToChn`) was compiled into the Maruko binary too — and the Star6E
ABI ran against the Maruko kernel/lib pair, producing the
`MI_DEVICE_Ioctl → kfree → compound_head` oops with a userspace-shaped
pointer reaching kfree.  Cure was a one-line conditional fix plus the
expected dep-preload + module-ID-34 + init-before-kthread changes:

- [x] **Build-time conditional fix.**  `src/debug_osd.c` first
  conditional now reads `#if defined(PLATFORM_STAR6E) && !defined(PLATFORM_MARUKO)`,
  so Maruko binaries enter the Maruko ABI branch as intended.
- [x] **Maruko ABI branch active.**  Targets the OpenIPC libmi_rgn.so
  v3 API (`MI_RGN_Init(soc_id, palette*)`, 3-arg `MI_RGN_Create`, 4-arg
  `MI_RGN_AttachToChn`, 64-bit `MI_PHY` / pointer-width `MI_VIRT` in
  `CanvasInfo_t`, module ID 34 = `E_MI_MODULE_ID_SCL`).
- [x] **Pre-load `libmi_rgn.so`.**  Added to the existing
  RTLD_GLOBAL dep chain in `maruko_mi_init()` alongside
  `libcam_os_wrapper`, `libmi_common`, `libispalgo`, `libcus3a`.
- [x] **Init-before-kthread ordering.**  `debug_osd_create()` now
  runs ahead of `bind_maruko_pipeline()` and any
  `MI_VENC_StartRecvPic` so the v5.10 OpenIPC `mi_rgn` driver's
  singlethread workqueue is created from the main task.
- [x] **Phase 2 safety gate dropped.**
- [x] **Verified on 192.168.2.12** (OpenIPC SSC378QE / IMX415
  1472x816@120, kernel 5.10.61): RGN init/create/attach/getcanvas
  all succeed, encode loop runs at ~117 fps, no kernel taint, OSD
  canvas mapped at 1472x816 stride 736.

Recipe cross-referenced with `waybeam-hub/src/rgn_backend_maruko.c`,
which had already verified the same pattern against the same kernel/lib.

### Phase 3 — IMU / BMI270 wiring (DONE, v0.9.13 — Maruko ordering caveat)

**Re-probe outcome (2026-05-02, after sensor module swap on
192.168.2.12):** BMI270 detected at `0x68` on `/dev/i2c-1` (chip ID
`0x24`). Earlier "no IMU on this board" result was a missing/loose
sensor pack, not a hardware-class limitation.

**What shipped (PR #84, branch `feature/maruko-imu-bmi270`):**

- [x] `src/imu_bmi270.c` moved from `STAR6E_ONLY_SRC` to `HELPER_SRC`
  in the Makefile so both backends pull it in.
- [x] `MarukoBackendConfig.imu` mirrors `VencConfig.imu`; defaulted in
  `maruko_config_defaults`, copied through in `maruko_config_from_venc`.
- [x] `MarukoBackendContext.imu` lifecycle wired in
  `maruko_pipeline.{configure_graph,process_stream,teardown_graph}`:
  `imu_init` + `imu_start` at graph configure time, `imu_drain` per
  iteration before `MI_VENC_GetStream`, `imu_stop`/`destroy` in teardown.
- [x] Push callback is a no-op stub (`maruko_pipeline_imu_push`) for
  this phase — sample sink is reserved for follow-up consumers
  (sidecar, recording, etc.).

**Maruko-specific ordering caveat (worth carrying forward to any
new "thread starts a long bring-up before VENC starts" feature):**

- On Star6E, IMU init is fine *after* `bind_maruko_pipeline` /
  `MI_VENC_StartRecvPic`.
- On Maruko (this hardware, OpenIPC libmi_venc), running the
  ~2 s BMI270 auto-bias loop **after** `MI_VENC_StartRecvPic` leaves the
  VENC fd in a state where `poll(POLLIN)` never wakes — the stream loop
  prints "waiting for encoder data..." indefinitely (observed 12 s +).
- Cure: call `imu_init` *before* `bind_maruko_pipeline` in
  `maruko_pipeline_configure_graph`. With `calSamples=400` the encoder
  recovers cleanly: live test showed 1963 IMU samples drained over 9 s
  at 118 fps with 0 errors and clean teardown.
- A short calibration window (`calSamples=50`, ~250 ms) also worked,
  but the ordering fix is the proper cure rather than rationing the
  sample count.
- Inline comment in `maruko_pipeline.c:configure_graph` documents the
  constraint so a future cleanup that "unifies" the lifecycle order
  doesn't silently re-introduce the stall.

**Verified on 192.168.2.12** (OpenIPC SSC378QE / IMX415, BMI270):
`json_cli -s 'imu.enabled=true'` followed by `waybeam` (config path
fixed to `/etc/waybeam.json`),
9 s capture, 1963 IMU samples, 0 errors, encoder steady at 118 fps,
no warnings during teardown.

### Phase 4 — Sensor-mode unlock on reinit (medium-architectural, plan ahead)

**Why here:** unblocks live `video0.size` AR-change for Maruko, which is a
prerequisite for any future feature that wants per-channel resolution
(recording, dual-stream). Doing this before audio/recording avoids painting
into a corner.

- **Step 0 (investigation):** reproduce the "ISP hang on mode switch"
  mentioned in `maruko_runtime.c:99-107`. Capture dmesg + venc.log.
- Try the same `VPE_SCL_preset_shutdown` sysfs clock trick that fixed
  Star6E (`star6e_pipeline.c:60-77`) — write to `/sys/.../clk_vpe`,
  `clk_scl` after `MI_SYS_Exit` to reset kernel `already_inited` flag.
- If that fails, gate the unlock behind a config flag
  (`isp.allow_mode_switch=false` default) so we ship a safe-mode fallback.
- **Re-evaluation gate:** if reinit unlock proves expensive (>3 days),
  skip it and proceed to Phase 5 — Maruko users keep restart-required mode
  switching. Document the decision in `HISTORY.md`.

### Phase 5 — MI_AI shim + audio capture port (DONE, v0.9.15)

The i6c MI_AI ABI turned out NOT to be a renamed Star6E API: it uses
`(devId, chnGrpIdx, channel-array)` with `MI_AI_Open`/`AttachIf`/
`Read`/`ReleaseData`, totally different from Star6E's `MI_AI_Enable`/
`SetPubAttr`/`EnableChn`/`GetFrame`.  Capture state machine is
Maruko-specific (`src/maruko_audio.c`); only the encode/output side
(Opus + G.711 + stdout filter) was lifted into a new shared helper
(`src/audio_codec.{c,h}`).

What shipped:
- [x] `maruko_ai_impl` added to `include/maruko_mi.h` /
  `src/maruko_mi.c`.  Loads `libmi_ai.so` with `RTLD_LAZY|RTLD_GLOBAL`
  and tolerates absence (audio disables, rest of pipeline keeps running).
- [x] Vendored `vendor-libs/maruko/libmi_ai.so` (110 KB) +
  `libmi_ao.so` (85 KB) from the SDK uClibc bundle.  Bench's
  monolithic `mi.ko` (2.1 MB) already exposes `/dev/mi_ai` and
  `/proc/mi_modules/mi_ai`, so no kmod insmod is needed.
- [x] `include/maruko_ai_types.h` — small set of MI_AI types copied
  verbatim from SDK headers (Attr / Data / Format / SoundMode / If).
- [x] `src/maruko_audio.c` (~510 LOC) — capture thread on `SCHED_FIFO`,
  encode thread reusing shared codec helpers, RTP / compact UDP send
  via a thin `MarukoAudioOutput` (port_override → dedicated socket;
  port=0 → share video target).
- [x] `MarukoBackendConfig` mirrors `vcfg->audio` + `audio_port` +
  `max_payload_size` so the pipeline doesn't see `VencConfig`.
- [x] `MarukoBackendContext` gets `audio` (state) +
  `audio_recorder_ring` (encoder→TS bridge).  Init after
  `bind_maruko_pipeline`, teardown after `stop_dual` and
  `ts_recorder_stop` so no consumer races the ring destroy.
- [x] `maruko_controls.c` binds `apply_mute = maruko_apply_mute` →
  `maruko_audio_apply_mute` → `MI_AI_SetMute(0, 0, [bool], 1)`.
- [x] `star6e_audio.c` migrated to the shared `audio_codec.{c,h}`
  helpers — `Star6eAudioState.opus_lib` / `opus_enc` replaced by
  `AudioCodecOpus opus`, no behavioural change on Star6E.
- [x] Phase 6 TS recorder picks up audio automatically: `ts_recorder_init`
  is called with `(audio.sample_rate, audio.channels)` when capture
  is active, and `ts_recorder_start` is given
  `&ctx->audio_recorder_ring` so PMT advertises an audio PID and the
  existing `ts_mux_write_audio` path interleaves PCM frames.

Caveats:
- SSC378QE bench's analog mic wiring is unverified.  Init succeeds and
  `MI_AI_Read` returns frames; whether they contain real audio depends
  on the board's codec/mic hookup.  The pipeline path itself is fully
  exercised regardless.
- `libmi_ao.so` is vendored alongside but no playback path is wired —
  reserved for a future Phase 5b.

### Phase 6 — TS recording (DONE for `mirror` + `dual`, v0.9.14)

Branch `feature/maruko-recording`, stacked on
`feature/maruko-dual-venc-port`.  Reused the Star6E recorder state
machine + TS mux verbatim; only the per-backend NAL extraction differs.

- [x] Promoted `src/star6e_recorder.c`, `src/star6e_ts_recorder.c`,
  `src/ts_mux.c` from `STAR6E_ONLY_SRC` to a shared `RECORDER_SRC`
  list.  No `#ifdef PLATFORM_*` was needed — the files already only
  reference type names from `star6e.h`, which Maruko's build pulls in
  for `MI_SYS_ChnPort_t`.
- [x] Added small adapter `src/maruko_ts_recorder.c` that pulls NAL
  units out of `i6c_venc_strm` and feeds the shared
  `star6e_ts_recorder_write_video()` primitive.  Mirrors
  `star6e_ts_recorder_write_stream()` 1:1.
- [x] `MarukoBackendConfigRecord` extended with `dir`, `format`,
  `max_seconds`, `max_mb` (already present on the generic
  `VencConfigRecord`).
- [x] **mirror** mode: chn 0 frames are written to the .ts file before
  release, alongside RTP send.  Guarded by `!ctx->dual` so dual mode
  never co-writes.
- [x] **dual** mode: chn 1's drain thread feeds the recorder while
  chn 0 keeps streaming RTP.  Discriminated via `d->is_dual_stream`.
- [x] TS recorder is initialised regardless of mode and started
  AFTER `start_dual` so the drain thread sees a non-negative `fd` by
  the time it pulls the first frame.  Stopped in `teardown_graph`
  AFTER `stop_dual` (no race window).

**Out of scope (deferred to follow-up PRs):**
- Raw `.hevc` recorder on Maruko (the `_write_frame` adapter still
  takes Star6E's `MI_VENC_Stream_t`; will land alongside Phase 5
  audio).  TS is the only supported `format` on Maruko today.
- HTTP `/api/v1/record/start|stop` for Maruko (daemon-config-driven
  only for now — the Star6E HTTP path uses `record_status_callback`
  and a `recordings_*` table that still has Star6E-specific assumptions).
- Audio mux into the TS container (Phase 5 — Maruko has no audio
  backend yet).
- SD card mount on test unit 192.168.2.12 — slot's CD switch never
  asserts (PAD6 stuck HIGH).  Verification target is `/tmp` tmpfs
  for now.

### Phase 7 — Dual VENC probe + port (DONE; dual-stream live, dual-record awaits Phase 6)

**Probe (PR #85, env-gated, kept long-term):**
- [x] All three SDK stages returned 0 (`CreateChn` / `SetInputSourceConfig` /
  `StartRecvPic`) for chn 1 on dev 0 after chn 0 was bound.  Probe code
  in `maruko_start_venc()` lives behind `MARUKO_DUAL_VENC_PROBE=1` so
  a future SDK refresh can be re-checked with one env var.

**Port (branch `feature/maruko-dual-venc-port`):**
- [x] `MarukoDualVenc` lifecycle (alloc / create chn 1 / bind / drain
  thread / output / teardown) wired in `maruko_pipeline.c`.
- [x] `record.{enabled,mode,server,bitrate,fps,gopSize,frameLost}`
  honoured for `mode="dual-stream"`; default `"off"` keeps existing
  single-channel behaviour.
- [x] Maruko-specific topology discoveries documented inline:
  - **Bind source is VENC chn 0's output port, NOT the SCL port.**
    SCL/0/0 already holds chn 0 in RING mode and rejects a second
    consumer with `0xA0092012` (SYS busy).  The Maruko SDK exposes
    a chn 0 → chn 1 HW_RING fan-out for dual-VENC instead.
  - **Both VENC channels must exist before SCL → chn 0 is bound.**
    Adding chn 1 after the SCL bind drops chn 0 from 25 Mbps to
    ~5 Mbps (encoder enters degraded mode).  `start_dual` unbinds
    SCL → chn 0, creates chn 1, then re-binds SCL → chn 0 — safe
    because the call site is `configure_graph` which runs before
    the encoder loop, so no in-flight frames are lost.
  - **Sub-channel uses the default `NORMAL_FRMBASE` input mode**, not
    `RING_UNIFIED_DMA`.  The SDK sample omits `SetInputSourceConfig`
    on chn 1 entirely; explicitly setting `RING_DMA` starves the
    sub-channel (no frames ever arrive).
- [x] Adaptive bitrate throttler (10 % step-down on sustained
  backpressure) ported from Star6E `dual_rec_reduce_bitrate`.
- [x] Drain thread mirrors `star6e_runtime.c:dual_rec_thread_fn` —
  poll(`MI_VENC_GetFd`) → `Query` → `GetStream` → `maruko_video_send_frame`
  → `ReleaseStream`.
- [x] **Verified on 192.168.2.12** (OpenIPC SSC378QE / IMX415
  1472x816@120):
  - chn 0: 117–118 fps @ 23–25 Mbps (= configured 25 Mbps, no
    regression vs single-channel baseline).
  - chn 1: 30 fps @ 3.6 Mbps measured over 10 s (configured CBR
    8 Mbps; H.265 backs off on low-motion test scene — expected
    CBR behaviour).
  - 4.5 MB received on chn 1's UDP destination port over 10 s.
- [ ] Re-evaluate Phase 6 (recording): dual-record (`mode="dual"`)
  uses chn 1's frames + TS mux + SD card writer; lands when the
  Phase 6 recording stack is wired (independent — TS engine in
  `src/ts_mux.c` is already platform-agnostic).

### Phase 8 — Maruko sensor depth (deferred, driver-gated)

Mode/fps mapping, direct ISP-bin load stability, >30fps verification. The
`CURRENT_STATUS` says "deferred until newer driver." Keep deferred, but
probe at the start of each phase to see if a newer driver landed.

### Phase 9 — CPU perf: opt-in 3A throttle (DONE, v0.9.12 — PR #83)

Shipped as PR #83 (`feature/maruko-cus3a-throttle`, stacked on PR #81).
Replaces the SDK `3A_Proc_0` thread (NATIVE algorithm running at sensor
frame rate) with a no-op AE adaptor registered via
`CUS3A_RegInterfaceEX(ADAPTOR_1)` and a 15 Hz supervisory thread that
drives AE manually via `MI_ISP_CUS3A_SetAeParam`. AWB stays on the SDK
NATIVE path. Saves ~24% sys CPU at 120 fps on Cortex-A7 (60% → 36% sys);
IQ knobs still respond instantly because `MI_ISP_EnableUserspace3A`
keeps the IQ→HW pump alive.

- Opt-in via config field `isp.aeMode = "throttle"`; default
  `"native"` preserves existing behaviour and gives a safety hatch if a
  different sensor / firmware breaks the no-op adaptor.
- Verified on 192.168.2.12: `native` ~50% CPU, `throttle` ~36% CPU at
  120 fps.

---

## Re-evaluation triggers

Revisit and rewrite this plan if any of these happen:

1. Phase 4 sensor-mode unlock investigation costs >3 days → drop unlock,
   ship config-gated lock + restart-required path. Phase 6 falls back to
   "record at startup-fixed resolution only".
2. Phase 7 dual-VENC SDK probe fails → drop Gemini mode entirely on
   Maruko. Update `HISTORY.md` and `documentation/SD_CARD_RECORDING.md` to
   mark Maruko as "single-channel record only".
3. New Maruko driver lands during the work → reorder Phase 8 sensor-depth
   ahead of audio if it unblocks higher-FPS streaming (more user-visible
   than audio).
4. A BMI270-equipped Maruko board appears → reopen Phase 3. **(Done —
   board appeared 2026-05-02, Phase 3 closed in v0.9.13.)**

## Open work / next decision point

Phases 1, 2, 2b, 3, 6 (`mirror` + `dual`), 7 (probe + port), and 9
are closed. Live branches/PRs: #81 (Phases 1/2/2b), #83 (Phase 9),
#84 (Phase 3), #85 (Phase 7 probe), `feature/maruko-dual-venc-port`
(Phase 7 port, PR #86), `feature/maruko-recording` (Phase 6, PR
pending).  Next agenda:

1. **Phase 5 (audio)** — biggest remaining standalone gap (Opus/G.711
   + MI_AI shim).  Independent of Phase 4, so can land any time.
   Once landed, it also unlocks audio mux into the Phase 6 TS file
   (`audio_ring → ts_mux_write_audio`) — Star6E already wires this
   so the Maruko side is mostly the AI capture + audio_ring push.
   Cost: ~3-4 days.
2. **Phase 6.5 (recording follow-ups)** — small, on demand:
   - Raw `.hevc` recorder for Maruko (mirror Star6E adapter).
   - HTTP `/api/v1/record/start|stop` for Maruko — still TODO; needs
     a Maruko consumer of `venc_api_get_record_start/stop` flags in
     the main loop.  (The `record_status_callback` half landed in
     contract `0.8.4`; Maruko now reports live recorder state but
     `/start|stop` still return 501 because the request flags have
     no consumer.)
   - Adaptive bitrate while SD-bound (the dual thread already has
     it — only matters once a real SD card is in play).
3. **Phase 4 (live AR-change reinit)** — medium-arch, unblocks
   per-channel resolution.  Lower priority now that Phase 7
   provides a separate channel for recording at a different
   resolution.

Recommendation: Phase 5 (audio) is the natural next item — it is the
last big user-visible parity gap and it also retroactively completes
the Phase 6 TS file (audio PMT + interleaved PCM packets).

## Architectural notes worth carrying

- **MI shim layer** is the dlopen abstraction (`maruko_mi.{c,h}`). Every
  new SDK API needs an entry there. Phase 5 (audio) is the first time we
  extend it; once the pattern is solid, future SDK ports are templated.
- **Reinit pattern divergence:** Star6E uses respawn-after-exit, Maruko
  uses in-process loop. Don't unify yet — let Phase 4 settle first, then
  revisit at end of Phase 7.
- **Config field gating:** prefer `isp.allow_mode_switch=false` and
  `record.mode="mirror"` defaults on Maruko until each phase ships. This
  avoids surprise behavior changes for existing users.
